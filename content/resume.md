# Profile

A self-reliant technical writer with 9 years' experience in the software development industry.

As a lone writer throughout most of my career, I’ve worked both as an individual contributor and a documentation function lead.

As a contributor, I write and edit developer-facing documentation for internal and external audiences. This includes tutorials, how-to guides, and API documentation.

As a function lead, I establish processes and guidelines, shape up the information architecture of internal knowledge, create templates, and audit content. I do regular surveys to stay on track with what users need, and rely on a maturity model to bring the organization’s documentation to the next level.

Since 2015, I’ve worked at tech-driven logistics companies, such as Lazada and Ninja Van.

I live in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

# Experience

## Senior Technical Writer, Ninja Van, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam — 2021-present
A lone technical writer leading the function and supporting a team of over 200 people, including engineers, product managers, and QA testers. My responsibilities as a writer are external-facing API documentation, tutorials, how-tos and user guides. As a function lead, I maintain the Confluence wiki and make sure that users adhere to the guidelines and processes.

Accomplishments:
* Rewrote and expanded the company’s [API portal](https://api-docs.ninjavan.co). This reduced the number of support requests and documentation-related complaints.
* Introduced a style guide and other documentation-related guidelines and processes. As confirmed by quarterly surveys, this improved the users' perception of the documentation quality.
* Created a tutorial that cut down the QA engineers' onboarding time from 2 weeks to a few days.

## Senior Technical Writer, Lazada Group, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam — 2018-2021
Joined a logistics technology branch of Lazada Group. Created documentation for the engineering teams working in the logistics domain, as well as the cybersecurity team.

Accomplishments:

* Created a documentation set for an attendance management system.
* Wrote tutorials and manuals for Alibaba's middleware (access gateway, log management platform, key management system). Created a simple Java app and used it as an example in all the docs.
* Created the first (and only) company-wide glossary of terms, and built a chat bot for easy retrieval of the definitions.
* Executed a project of migrating content from Confluence to a proprietary knowledge management platform known as Yuque. This made documentation available to other stakeholders, not just developers and product managers.
* Created onboarding documentation for new joiners as well as developer guidelines to help get started with the development environment.

## Technical Writer, Lazada Group, Singapore — 2017–2018
Created documentation in information security and access management domains. Provided content for company-wide projects carried out by the cybersecurity team. Note that at this point, Lazada was going through the acquisition by Alibaba Group.

## Technical Writer, Lazada Group, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam — 2015–2017
Joined a team of developers, QA engineers, and product managers as the first technical writer at the company. Under no supervision, established a technical writing workflow and documented critical processes and areas of the e-commerce software development.

Accomplishments:

* Created the first of its kind system architecture diagram and met with developers and tech leads from multiple countries in the process.
* Created project management guidelines together with the respective team.

## Technical Writer, Lintelus Inc (US), remotely — 2014–2015
After SwitchRay was acquired by a US-based company, I joined them to help document a Zoom-like event management software. I worked remotely with the developers and product managers. In this role, I created and maintained documentation for the administrator, event organizer, and event participant roles. The latest version of the docs was shipped in DOC/PDF along with each major release.

## Technical Writer, SwitchRay, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia — 2013–2014
The company changed its name to SwitchRay. I was assigned a new project—a telecom fraud detection and prevention system. I wrote user guides, release notes, and marketing content.

## Technical Writer, MFI Soft, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia — 2012–2013
Joined the technical writing team to contribute to installation, configuration, and maintenance documentation for a suite of VoIP soft-switches. The domain was quite complex for me as a fresh graduate, but the colleagues helped me grasp the basics. The content was published in an internal version control system and shipped to end customers.

Accomplishments:
* Learned how to use Help&Manual with conditional formatting to prepare PDF/DOC outputs for three major releases of the soft-switch.
* Gained my first experience of writing software documentation in English while working on release notes and user guides, with my then supervisor acting as an editor.
