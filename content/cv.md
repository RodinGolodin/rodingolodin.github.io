## Profile

A self-reliant technical writer with 10 years’ experience in the software development industry. As a lone writer throughout most of my career, I’ve worked both as an individual contributor and a documentation function lead.

As a contributor, I write and edit developer-facing documentation for internal and external audiences. This includes tutorials, how-to guides, and API documentation.

As a function lead, I establish processes and guidelines, design the information architecture of documentation portals, create templates, and audit the content. I do regular surveys to stay on track with what users need, and rely on a maturity model to bring the organization’s documentation to the next level.

Since 2015, I’ve worked in the e-commerce industry, at companies such as Lazada and Ninja Van. In 2023, I joined Sky Mavis, the Web3 startup behind the Axie Infinity game and the Ronin blockchain.

I live in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

Often doubting myself, I've worked hard to be where I am today. I might be a lone writer, but I would never have made it without the amazing and pasionate colleagues and friends who accompanied me along this journey. Thank you.
