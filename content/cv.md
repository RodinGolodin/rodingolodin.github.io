# Profile

A self-reliant technical writer with 8 years of experience in the software development industry.

As a lone writer throughout most of my career, I’ve worked both as an individual contributor and a documentation function lead.

As a contributor, I write and edit developer-facing documentation for internal and external audiences. This includes tutorials, how-to guides, and API documentation.

As a function lead, I establish processes and guidelines, shape up the information architecture of internal knowledge, create templates, and audit content. I do regular surveys to stay on track with what users need, and rely on a maturity model to bring the organization’s documentation to the next level.

Since 2015, I’ve worked at tech-driven logistics companies, such as Lazada and Ninja Van.

I live in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

# Experience

## Senior Technical Writer, Ninja Van, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam — 2021-present
A lone technical writer leading the function and supporting a team of over 200 people, including engineers, product managers, and QA testers.

My responsibilities as a writer are external-facing API documentation, tutorials, how-tos and user guides. As a function lead, I maintain the Confluence wiki and make sure that users adhere to the guidelines and page hierarchy, among other things.

Accomplishments:
* Rewrote and expanded the company’s API portal (https://api-docs.ninjavan.co). This reduced the number of support requests and documentation-related complaints.
* Introduced a style guide and other documentation-related guidelines and processes. As confirmed by quarterly surveys, this improved the users' perception of the documentation quality.
* Created a tutorial that cut down the QA engineers' onboarding time from 2 weeks to a few days.

## Senior Technical Writer, Lazada Group, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam — 2018-2021
Transferred to Lazada Logistics Tech. Created documentation for the engineering teams working in the logistics domain, as well as the cybersecurity team.

Accomplishments:
* Created and maintained a context-level architecture diagram for the entire ecosystem.
* Created REST API specs for 35 micro services and as a follow-up, developed API documentation guidelines together with tech leads. The changes were pushed to a git repository before being reviewed as code.
* Created a documentation set for an attendance management system.
* Wrote tutorials and manuals for Alibaba's middleware (access gateway, log management platform, key management system). I created a simple Java app and used it as an example in all the docs.
* Created the first (and only) company-wide glossary of terms and built a chat bot for easy interaction with the glossary.
* Executed a project of migrating content from Confluence to a proprietary knowledge management platform known as Yuque. This made documentation available to other stakeholders, not just developers and product managers.
* Administered a Confluence instance while maintaining writing standards. After the re-platforming project, continued managing permissions in the new wiki.
* Created onboarding documentation for new joiners as well developer guidelines to help get started with the development environment.

## Technical Writer, Lazada Group, Singapore — 2017–2018
Created documentation for information security and access management domains. Provided content for company-wide projects carried out by the cybersecurity team. Note that at this point, Lazada was going through the acquisition by Alibaba Group.

Accomplishments:
* Created user documentation for the launch of BlackBerry UEM mobility management platform.
* Designed a SharePoint site and created a knowledge base and an FAQ for a large project on migrating content Google Docs to Office365
* While on a business trip to Alibaba HQ in Hangzhou (China), held meetings with the DingTalk messenger team and created a documentation suite to help onboard thousands of Lazada employees to the new messenger.
* While on a business trip to Bangkok, interviewed a third-party contractor’s engineering team as their product, an invoice management system, was being handed over to Lazada’s internal developers. Facilitated the handover by creating comprehensive tech docs suite that included data flow diagrams, sequence diagrams, and context diagrams.
* Created a knowledge base for the internal identity and access management portal.
  
## Technical Writer, Lazada Group, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam — 2015–2017
Joined a team of 100+ developers, QA engineers, and product managers as a first technical writer to have been hired by Lazada. Under no supervision, established a technical writing workflow and documented critical processes and areas of the eCommerce software development.

Accomplishments:
* Built and maintained administrator documentation for the backend engine and order management systems.
* Created the first of its kind system architecture diagram and met with developers and tech leads from multiple countries in the process.
* Created project management guidelines together with the respective team.
* Held a presentation on the role of technical writing and documentation in software development (never hurts to emphasize the importance of that!).
* Created a configuration guide for a complex shipping fee calculation feature.
* Created on-boarding documentation for new employees, first of its kind at the company.

## Technical Writer, Lintelus Inc (US), remotely — 2014–2015
SwitchRay was acquired by a US company and I had a chance to join their new project—somewhat like Zoom today but less ambitious. I got onboard as a documentation consultant and worked remotely with the US-based team of developers and product managers.

Accomplishments:
* Created and maintained documentation for the administrator, event organizer, and event participant roles. The latest version of the docs was shipped in DOC/PDF along with each major release.

## Technical Writer, SwitchRay, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia — 2013–2014
MFI Soft was reorganized and changed its name to “SwitchRay”. I was assigned to write public-facing documentation—user guides, release notes, marketing content—for a telecom fraud detection and prevention system.

## Technical Writer, MFI Soft, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia — 2012–2013
Joined the tech writing team to support a release pipeline of installation, configuration, and maintenance documentation for VoIP soft-switches. The domain was quite complex for me as a new graduate, but the colleagues (and some reading) helped me grasp the basics and I got to work. The documents were published in an internal version control system and shipped to the customers in multiple formats along with the software.

Accomplishments:
* Learned how to use Help&Manual with conditional formatting to prepare PDF/DOC outputs for three major releases of the soft-switch.
* Gained my first experience of writing software documentation in English while working on release notes and user guides, with my then supervisor acting as an editor.
* Learned what the documentation development life cycle was in practice—analyzing, designing, developing, editing, publishing, maintaining.
* Gained initial experience in interviewing SMEs.
