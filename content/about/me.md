## Hi, I'm Sergey

I'm an experienced solo technical writer and a documentation evangelist who loves working with software development teams. My two areas of expertise are internal-facing documentation, and external-facing API documentation. 

On the internal side of things, I focus on establishing processes, procedures, and templates that help engineering teams keep their documentation in good shape and up-to-date. As a writer, I produce developer documentation, such as tutorials, how-to guides, reference, and explanation articles. 

On the external side, I write API documentation so that other developers can integrate with the company's services. User-driven documentation aren't just buzzwords to meâ€”I run regular documentation usability surveys, analyze content against a maturity model, and try to always get as much feedback as possible about my documentation.
