Hi, my name is Sergey. I'm a software technical writer with 10 years of experience in the logistics and Web3 industries.

From 2015 to 2023, I worked as a technical writer in the logistics industry in Southeast Asia, focusing on internal and external documentation and processes.

In 2023, I joined Sky Mavis, a Web3 gaming startup behind the popular Axie Infinity game and the Ronin blockchain. At Sky Mavis, I write and proofread content for developers and end users, design the information architecture and maintain the underlying infrastructure of the documentation websites.

Web3 is a new industry for me, so I've had to learn everything from scratch. Despite the steep learning curve, I enjoyed it immensely. After all, if you're not learning, you're not growing as a professional.

I'm an avid reader, and I explore topics like geopolitics, psychology, mental health, and linguistics. I enjoy long-distance walks and recently started running. I live in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
