Hi, my name is Sergey. I’m a software technical writer with 10 years’ experience.

From 2015 until 2023, I worked as a technical writer in the logistics industry in Southeast Asia. I focused on internal-facing documentation and processes, as well as external-facing content.

In 2023, I joined a company called Sky Mavis, a Web3 gaming startup behind the popular Axie Infinity game and the Ronin blockchain network. At Sky Mavis, I write and proofread end-user content, design the information architecture of the company's docs, and maintain the docs sites' infrastructure.

Since Web3 is a completely new industry for me, I had to learn everything from scratch. Despite the steep learning curve, I greatly enjoyed it. After all, if you're not learning, how would you grow as a professional?
