I'm an experienced solo technical writer and a documentation evangelist who loves working with software development teams. My areas of expertise are internal-facing content and processes, and external-facing documentation.

On the internal side of things, I focus on establishing processes, procedures, and templates that help engineering teams keep their documentation in good shape and up-to-date. As a writer, I produce a range of developer documentation, including API docs, READMEs, how-tos, tutorials, getting started guides, reference articles, and more.

On the external side, I contribute to and maintain an API reference portal used by partner developers to integrate with the company's services. 

"User-driven documentation" aren't just buzzwords to meâ€”I learn what readers want and need through regular surveys, interviews, and research. This approach helps me develop content that solves users' actual problems, while emphasizing the importance of documentation across the organization.
