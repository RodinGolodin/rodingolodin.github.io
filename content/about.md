Hi, my name is Sergey. I'm a software technical writer with 10 years' experience.

From 2015 until 2023, I worked as a technical writer in the logistics instdustry in Southeast Asia. I focused on internal-facing documentation and processes, as well as external-facing content.

In 2023, I joined a company called Sky Mavis, a Web3 gaming startup behind the popular Axie Infinity game and the Ronin blockchain network. At Sky Mavis, I write and proofread end-user content, while maintaining the documentation websites infrastructure.

Since Web3 is a completely new industry for me, I had to learn everything from scratch. I've enjoyed the learning curve tremendously. Also, I've always wanted to write end-user content, and I'm happy to say I'm finally doing it.
