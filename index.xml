I&amp;rsquo;m a software technical writer with 8 years of experience. Since 2015, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked as a solo writer at engineering-driven logistics companies in Southeast Asia, where I focused on internal-facing documentation and processes, as well as external-facing content. As a lone writer, part of my job is to maintain a corporate knowledge base, and this is where I put on the hat of an information architect.</description></item><item><title>Contact me</title><link>https://www.sergeyrodin.com/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sergeyrodin.com/contact/</guid><description> LinkedIn Email</description></item><item><title>Resume</title><link>https://www.sergeyrodin.com/resume/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sergeyrodin.com/resume/</guid><description>Profile A self-reliant technical writer with 9 years&amp;rsquo; experience in the software development industry.
As a lone writer throughout most of my career, Iâ€™ve worked both as an individual contributor and a documentation function lead.
As a contributor, I write and edit developer-facing documentation for internal and external audiences. This includes tutorials, how-to guides, and API documentation.
As a function lead, I establish processes and guidelines, shape up the information architecture of internal knowledge, create templates, and audit content.</description></item><item><title>Writing samples</title><link>https://www.sergeyrodin.com/samples/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sergeyrodin.com/samples/</guid><description>This page contains my selected writing samples.
