      <description>Hi, my name is Sergey. I&amp;rsquo;m a software technical writer with 10 years&amp;rsquo; experience.
Since 2015, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked as a writer for logistics companies in Southeast Asia. I focused on internal-facing documentation and processes, as well as external-facing content.
In 2023, I joined a company called Sky Mavis, a Web3 gaming startup behind the popular Axie Infinity game and the Ronin blockchain network. At Sky Mavis, I write and proofread end-user content, while maintaining the documentation websites infrastructure.</description>

      <description>Profile A self-reliant technical writer with 10 years’ experience in the software development industry. As a sole writer throughout most of my career, I’ve worked both as an individual contributor and a documentation function lead.
As a contributor, I write and edit developer-facing documentation for internal and external audiences. This includes tutorials, how-to guides, and API documentation.
As a function lead, I establish processes and guidelines, shape up the information architecture of internal knowledge, create templates, and audit content.</description>
